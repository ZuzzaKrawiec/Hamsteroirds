Gameplay Programmer
Your test assignment is to create (in UE5) a game like this: Celebrating Garden Gnomes.
The idea is to replicate all core mechanics of the game. If you want to add anything from
yourself (additional mechanics, visual effects etc.) you’re more than welcome, but the core
loop and mechanics should remain the same and any additional work should be
documented.

Requirements:
● Map should be constructed from modules, so it should be 'endless' like in the original game
(new random modules are added as you fly through in a way that shouldn’t be visible)

● You need to implement at least 3 skills and 3 different gnomes (one per gnome, you may
implement more skills and gnomes of course), you may invent your skills if you like! (you
should use some kind of abstraction that will allow you to easy add new skills)

General notes about the assignment:
● Majority of the logic should be done in C++. Using blueprints is permitted within
reason. A good example of this would be using blueprints as an endpoint for a C++
defined class and storing data there. A bad example would be creating your entire
logic in blueprints.

● Your Project should be created in Unreal Engine 5.1.1.

● You are not allowed to use any non-Epic plugins or ready solutions for the problem.

● Your code will be rated in terms of readability, cleanliness, architecture and
performance. Crashes shouldn’t occur as well as memory leaks.

● Your project should be delivered as both the packaged shipping build for windows
and a zipped project directory with temporary files stripped.

● With this you should also send a short document outlining your work, features and
implementation. Implementation documentation should be a brief outline of classes
in your code and stuff done in blueprints.

● For extra credit you can add other stuff to the project to make it more fun. Adding
new features, mechanics, vfx’s, sfx’s, extra map features etc. will be a plus. But those
things shouldn’t interfere with the basic functionalities outlined earlier. Additionally all
of the extra things added should be outlined in the documentation and explained
thoroughly. The more fun it is the better
